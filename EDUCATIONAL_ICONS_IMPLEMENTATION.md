# Educational Icons Implementation

## Overview
Educational icons have been successfully integrated into the KinyaRunner game to trigger quiz questions during gameplay.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Educational Icon Generation
- **Location**: `src/Game/environment.ts`
- **Frequency**: Every 15 seconds of gameplay (approximately 300 game units)
- **Types**: Three different icons for Math, Geography, and Science
- **Visual Design**:
  - Math: Blue cube with emissive glow
  - Geography: Green sphere with emissive glow  
  - Science: Purple octahedron with emissive glow

### 2. Icon Animation
- **Pulsing Effect**: Icons scale up and down smoothly
- **Rotation**: Continuous Y-axis rotation for visibility
- **Floating Motion**: Subtle X-axis rotation for dynamic feel

### 3. Collision Detection
- **Location**: `src/Game/contorlPlayer.ts`
- **Integration**: Added to all raycaster collision checks (FRONT, FRONTDOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)
- **Cooldown System**: 15-second cooldown prevents quiz spam
- **Event Emission**: Triggers `showQuiz` event with subject type

### 4. Quiz Integration
- **Event Handling**: App.vue listens for `showQuiz` events
- **Game Pause**: Automatically pauses game during quiz
- **Subject Selection**: Random selection from math, geography, science
- **Resume**: Game continues after quiz completion

## Technical Details

### Icon Spacing Algorithm
```typescript
// Educational icons appear every 300 units (15 seconds at 20 units/second)
const educationalSpacing = 300;
const distanceFromLast = lastEducationalPosition - collectibleBlock;
const shouldPlaceEducational = distanceFromLast >= educationalSpacing;
```

### Cooldown System
```typescript
// Prevents multiple quiz triggers in quick succession
const currentTime = Date.now();
if (currentTime - this.lastQuizTime >= this.quizCooldown) {
    // Trigger quiz
    this.lastQuizTime = currentTime;
}
```

### Icon Creation
```typescript
// Each subject has unique geometry and color
const mathIcon = new THREE.Mesh(
    new THREE.BoxGeometry(2, 2, 2),
    new THREE.MeshPhongMaterial({ color: 0x3498db, emissive: 0x1a5490 })
);
```

## Game Balance

### Frequency Control
- **Primary Control**: 15-second spacing in environment generation
- **Secondary Control**: 15-second cooldown in collision detection
- **Coin Reduction**: Regular coins now appear every 3rd position to balance collectibles

### Visual Feedback
- **Distinct Appearance**: Each subject has unique shape and color
- **Animation**: Pulsing and rotation make icons easily noticeable
- **Positioning**: Same height as coins (1.5 units) for consistent gameplay

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Frequency Testing**: Verify icons appear approximately every 15 seconds
2. **Collision Testing**: Ensure all movement directions trigger quiz correctly
3. **Cooldown Testing**: Confirm multiple rapid collisions don't spam quizzes
4. **Subject Distribution**: Check that all three subjects appear randomly
5. **Game Flow**: Verify smooth pause/resume during quiz interactions

## Future Enhancements

1. **Visual Improvements**: Add particle effects or better 3D models
2. **Adaptive Frequency**: Adjust icon frequency based on player performance
3. **Subject Balancing**: Track and balance subject distribution
4. **Achievement Integration**: Add achievements for educational milestones
5. **Difficulty Scaling**: Increase icon frequency as game progresses

## Files Modified

1. `src/Game/environment.ts` - Icon generation and spacing
2. `src/Game/contorlPlayer.ts` - Collision detection and cooldown
3. `src/App.vue` - Quiz event handling (already existed)
4. `src/stores/educationalStore.ts` - Quiz management (already existed)

The educational icon system is now fully integrated and ready for testing!
