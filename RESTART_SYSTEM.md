# 🔄 Game Restart System

## ✅ **Complete Restart Functionality**

The game now has a robust restart system that allows players to restart and play again after game over.

### 🎮 **How It Works**

#### **1. Game Over Detection**
- Player hits obstacle or makes too many mistakes
- Game status changes to 'end'
- GameOverCard appears with restart options

#### **2. Restart Process**
When player clicks "PLAY AGAIN":
1. **UI Reset** - Score and coins reset to 0
2. **Game State Reset** - All internal game states cleared
3. **Scene Cleanup** - All game objects removed from scene
4. **Fresh Start** - New game environment and player created
5. **Ready State** - Game returns to ready-to-play state

### 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

#### **App.vue - Main Restart Handler**
```javascript
const handleReplay = () => {
  // Reset UI state
  score.value = 0;
  coin.value = 0;
  isPaused.value = false;
  
  // Use built-in restart
  gameInstance.restart();
};
```

#### **Game.ts - Game Level Restart**
```javascript
restart() {
  if (this.player) {
    this.player.restartGame();
  }
}
```

#### **ControlPlayer.ts - Complete State Reset**
```javascript
public restartGame() {
  // Reset all game variables
  // Clear scene
  // Recreate environment
  // Reset player
  // Emit ready status
}
```
